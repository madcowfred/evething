EVEthing
========

EVEthing is a terribly named web application intended to ease the pain of managing your
`EVE Online <http://www.eveonline.com/>`_ space empire.

Features
========

- Handles all types of API key: account, character and corporation.
- Only crashes occasionally, honest.
- More than likely won't set your hard drive on fire.
- Home page: displays relevant information about all API keys attached to your account.

   * Character name, wallet balance, API key 'name' (in brackets) and total SP easily
     visible.
   * If the account is training, shows training skill, time remaining and training
     speed. Red completion bars have free room in the skill queue.
   * Red boxes highlight accounts with no characters in training.
   * Notification icons appear at the bottom of each character box and have basic
     tooltips, you can see the current types in the screenshot.
   * Wallet balances for any corporation keys are displayed underneath.
- Character page: displays character information similar to the in-game character sheet.
  If you've ever used `eveboard <http://eveboard.com>`_ you should know what to expect.

  (yes, that's me).
   * Basic info: portrait, corporation, wallet balance, total SP, clone limit, attributes and
     implants.
   * Skill queue.
   * Filled stars for trained levels, hollow stars for partially trained levels, weird heart icons for
     level V skills.
   * Full control over public visibility of character and of each component. If you're not
     logged in to the account that owns a character you will only see what the owner says
     you can see, or a 404 error if they choose to not be public.
   * Anonymous character support, accessed via a /character_anon/blah URL. Character name,
     corporation, wallet balance and implants are not shown and your portrait is replaced
     with a terrible placeholder image.
- API key management page: list keys, add keys, simple interface to generate a new key with
  a feature set. `Screenshot <https://github.com/madcowfred/evething/raw/develop/doc-images/apikeys.png>`_
- Assets page: lists assets for all characters with the relevant API mask. Includes ship
  and container names with the Locations mask. Filtering is somewhat limited and search is
  non-existent but the basic functionality is in and working.

- Blueprints page: lets you add/delete/edit/view blueprints you have added to the system.
  `Screenshot <https://github.com/madcowfred/evething/raw/develop/doc-images/blueprints.png>`_
   * See useful information at a glance for every blueprint you own (assuming you could be
     bothered entering them all).
   * Mark a selection of blueprints to use with BPCalc.
- BPCalc page: displays detailed production information and allows you to filter based on
  things. `Screenshot <https://github.com/madcowfred/evething/raw/develop/doc-images/bpcalc.png>`_
   * Displays blueprints, total m3 of inputs/ouputs, expected profit values from both buys
     and sells, and estimated weekly volume.
   * Not particularly powerful filters on the data:
      + Profit below a certain value
      + Movement above a certain value (so you don't make 300% of the weekly supply)
      + Limit slots to a certain value
      + Remove selected blueprints
   * Components table with IGB-clickable links for easy purchasing of items.
- Orders page: displays a summary of your market orders and a detailed list of all orders.
  `Screenshot <https://github.com/madcowfred/evething/raw/develop/doc-images/orders.png>`_
   * Summary table showing active order slots and total values involved.
   * Detailed active orders table listing all relevant information for each order, with
     clickable item names that lead to Transactions pages.
- Transactions page: displays a log of market transactions for all items or a specific
  item. `Screenshot <https://github.com/madcowfred/evething/raw/develop/doc-images/transactions.png>`_
   * All transactions page has clickable item links that lead to specific items.
- Trade page: displays a summary of all transactions by month and over specific 'Campaigns'.

Future Plans
============

- Take over the universe.
- Skill plan creation.
- Industry Job tracking.
- CREST integration if CCP ever actually releases something.

Installation
============

There are some common requirements for any install method, most of these will be installed
using pip in 'Common Install Steps' below:

- `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ >=2.6 <3.0
- `Django <http://www.djangoproject.com>`_ >=1.4
- `Celery <http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/>`_ >= 3.0
- `django-celery <http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/django/>`_ >= 3.0
- `Django MPTT <https://github.com/django-mptt/django-mptt/>`_ >=0.5
- `South <http://south.aeracode.org/>`_ >=0.7
- `Coffin <https://github.com/coffin/coffin/>`_ >=0.3
- `Jinja2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org/>`_ >=2.6
- A database server and relevant client library.
   * `SQLite <http://www.sqlite.org>`_ is the simplest and is often included with Python.
   * `MySQL <http://www.mysql.com>`_ is another option and highly likely to be available on
     shared hosting. You will need the `MySQLdb <http://mysql-python.sourceforge.net/MySQLdb.html>`_
     client library, ``pip install mysql-python``.
   * `PostgreSQL <http://www.postgresql.org>`_ is the last option and would be my choice.
     You will need the `psycopg <http://initd.org/psycopg/>`_ client library, ``pip install psycopg2``.
- The current EVE Static Data Export imported into a database. The recommended course is to get
  the SQLite conversion from `fuzzwork <http://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/dump/>`_ and use that as your
  'import' database. If you can't do that, `zofu <http://zofu.no-ip.de/>`_ has MySQL and Postgres
  versions that take a long, long time to import.

Common Install Steps
--------------------
#. Make a new virtualenv: ``python virtualenv.py thingenv``.
#. Activate the virtualenv: ``cd thingenv``, ``source bin/activate``.
#. Clone the EVEthing git repository: ``git clone -b develop git://github.com/madcowfred/evething.git``.
#. Install the required libraries using pip: ``cd evething``, ``pip install -r requirements.txt``.
#. Copy evething/local_settings.example to evething/local_settings.py then open
   local_settings.py in some sort of text editor and edit settings.
#. ``python manage.py syncdb``, say NO when it asks if you would like to create an admin user.
#. ``python manage.py migrate --all``, this will apply database migrations in order.
#. ``python manage.py createsuperuser`` to create a new superuser.
#. ``python import.py`` to import the initial data from the SDE database.

If you update EVEthing in the future, make sure to run ``python manage.py migrate thing``
to apply any database schema changes!

Common Post-install Steps
-------------------------
#. LEAVE DEBUG ENABLED FOR NOW - it will spit out tracebacks that should help you track down
   any problems.
#. Log in as the superuser you created earlier.
#. Click the username dropdown in the top right and head to Account Management.
#. Add one or more API keys.

Celery Worker Setup
-------------------
This is my third take on the API update process. v1 was api_updater.py with a single thread, this
worked relatively well for small numbers of keys but broke badly under load. v2 was api_updater.py
with multiple threads. After a lot of messing about with exciting threading bugs, I gave up and
learned about the wonders of `Celery <http://celery.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`_.

EVEthing will presently place jobs in 3 queues:
  * et_high: internal tasks such as spawning jobs, cleaning up the API cache, resetting 'broken' tasks.
  * et_low: low priority tasks, only APIKeyInfo calls right now.
  * et_medium: everything else.

There are a few possible ways to run the workers:
  * Single worker group (development, small installations):
    + ``python manage.py celery worker -B -Q et_high,et_medium,et_low -c 2``
  * Two worker groups (medium installations):
    + ``python manage.py celery worker -B -Q et_high -c 1``
    + ``python manage.py celery worker -Q et_medium,et_low -c 4``
    + This has been fine with up to 300 keys so far.
  * Three worker groups (large installations):
    + ``python manage.py celery worker -B -Q et_high -c 1``
    + ``python manage.py celery worker -B -Q et_low -c 1``
    + ``python manage.py celery worker -B -Q et_medium -c 5``
    + This keeps up with the 1070 key GoonFleet hosted version.

Local Install
-------------
This is for messing about with EVEthing and seeing what the hell it does, never use this for a
publicly accessible site (see: `Django docs <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/django-admin/#runserver-port-or-address-port>`_).

#. ``python manage.py runserver ip:port``.
#. Open http://ip:port/ in a web browser.

Apache Install
--------------
You will need to install Apache and `mod_wsgi <http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/>`_.

#. Make a directory somewhere to act as the site root. Do NOT use the same directory you
   placed the EVEthing files earlier.
#. Make a 'static' sub-directory inside this directory.
#. Add a vhost to your Apache config with these extra directives:

   ::

      Alias /static/ /www/whatever/static/

      <Directory /www/whatever>
          Order allow,deny
          Allow from all
      </DIrectory>

      WSGIDaemonProcess evething threads=2 user=nobody
      WSGIProcessGroup evething

      WSGIScriptAlias / /path/to/evething/wsgi.py

      <Directory /path/to/evething>
          <Files wsgi.py>
              Order allow,deny
              Allow from all
          </Files>
      </Directory>

#. Reload Apache config.
#. Run ``python manage.py collectstatic``, answer 'yes'.
#. Open http://whatever/ in a web browser.
#. To force an EVEthing reload later (updated code or changed config) simply ``touch wsgi.py``
   in the EVEthing directory.
